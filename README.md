# Slithering-Wiggling-Snake
This project is created for studying the effect of wiggling in snake gaits
When a snake moves, it doesn't only slither due to movements created by muscle torque, it also extends and shrinks, what we called wiggle.
What combination of wiggling and slithering make the fastest snake movement?
That is what we are studying.
